# Internship-Projects
As a Data Analytics Intern at Codveda Technology, I worked on real-world datasets to extract meaningful insights and build data-driven solutions. My responsibilities included:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized inconsistent data formats using Python and Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed statistical analysis and visualized patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify key trends and correlations.

Data Visualization: Created clear and informative charts such as bar plots, line charts, and scatter plots to communicate insights effectively.

Regression & Time Series Analysis: Built linear regression models, performed train-test splits, evaluated model performance, and analyzed time-series data to detect trends and seasonality.

Clustering & Classification Models: Implemented K-Means clustering for grouping data and trained classification models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict categorical outcomes.

Dashboard Creation: Designed and published interactive dashboards in Power BI to present data insights to stakeholders.

Sentiment Analysis (NLP): Preprocessed textual data and performed sentiment classification using NLTK/TextBlob, along with visualization through word clouds.


Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Power BI
